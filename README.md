# Hello-world-
First project. 
My name is Imanuel h. Baca. Im 18 years old and im teaching myself to code. As a kid i was intersted in simulated evolution and gentic algoriths. The idea of a computer modifying itself was increadble to me. I am now on a path to making my own self improving system. Python is my current coding language of choice.
